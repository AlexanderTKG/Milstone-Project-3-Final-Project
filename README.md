# TypeScript
### The reason I didn't use TypeScript in the examples provided is because, while I am familiar with its capabilities and benefits, I am still in the process of fully understanding its intricacies and best practices for implementing it in a project. TypeScript can add a significant level of complexity to a project and requires a deeper understanding of the language to effectively utilize its features. As such, I chose to use JavaScript and JSX in the examples provided in order to keep the focus on the core concepts being demonstrated, rather than the added complexity of TypeScript.
# Sass
### Although I have an understanding of using Sass, I have encountered difficulties applying it to the pages as the CSS styles were not being implemented as intended.
